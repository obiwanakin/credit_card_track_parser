CCFormFill
=============================

This Javscript library is for parsing credit card track data such as might be returned from a USB card reader.  It does not perform validation of the credit card number (such as Luhn checks); there are already many libraries that perform this.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_stripe_card for information about the format of track data.
